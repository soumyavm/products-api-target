1. The first application myRetail has been chosen for the case study. The application has been developed in Sprint boot using Sprint boot initializr.
2. The project products-api can be imported into any IDE and run.
3. When the application starts it will automatically start tomcat at 8000 port.
4. The application uses a local instance of MySQL running at 3306. The table name is 'pricelist'.
5. Few screenshots have been attached which show the Postman request for Get and Put calls.
6. Screenshot of Mysql DB is also attached.
7. The domain redsky.target isnt working - So the code to access that has been commented. 
And I am returning a "Dummy Product" string everytime.
8. The price API is accessible as a separate API as well within the same application domain and 
the Product api uses same price API using restTemplates
